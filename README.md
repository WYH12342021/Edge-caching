Edge caching for SIIoT
The introduction of edge caching technology into smart industrial Internet of Things (SIIoT) systems can effectively reduce redundant computation and data transmission, thereby improving resource utilization. However, the short data frames and stringent latency requirements characteristic of industrial tasks often result in decreased cache hit rates. Furthermore, in multi-edge-node industrial environments, cache redundancy across edge nodes becomes a prominent issue. To address these challenges, a distributed edge caching strategy tailored for industrial tasks is proposed. First, the Shot Noise Model (SNM) is employed to construct a task request pattern that captures the stochastic and dynamic nature of industrial task arrivals. Subsequently, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network is utilized to extract temporal features and model the evolving trends in device request patterns, enabling predictions of future task request distributions. Based on this, an LSTM-based Distributed Hash Proximal Policy Optimization Algorithm (LDHPA) is designed for dynamic edge caching in multi-node scenarios within SIIoT. This algorithm leverages a reinforcement learning framework to adaptively optimize caching decisions, effectively mitigating cache redundancy and load imbalance. Experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithm achieves superior performance in terms of task access latency, backhaul rate, cache hit rate, and network throughput compared to existing approaches.
